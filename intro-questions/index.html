            <li>Andrew Guevara, Communication Design, junior.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I enjoy illustration work in my field of study. I'm taking this class because I want to learn more about UX design in a digital space, and it's required.</li>
            <br>
            <li>I've never used HTML/CSS/JS, but I've dabbled in Java in the past (I haven't retained much though).</li>
            <br>
            <li>I hope to learn how to effectively lay out information in a digital space. Learning some additional aesthetic bells and whistles would be nice too.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Designing for paper involves much less (if any) user interactivity and input. Designing for screen involves more information-based hierarchy, like being able to find links or buttons leading to new pages.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.moma.org/">MoMA</a> website feels effective at design; it takes a minimalist approach to representing information that resembles its image as an artistic establishment.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> website exemplifies effective communication mainly due to the massive search bar at the top of the page. After searching for an item, a list of products supplemented with large images appears, making the process of shopping simple.</li>
            <br>
            <li>In my opinion, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a> works well as a website because the large search bar and grid of visually-driven videos feel intuitive and unintrusive.</li>
