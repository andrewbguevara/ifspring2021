                <br>
                <p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair</p>
                <p>Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air</p>
                <p>Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light</p>
                <p>My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim</p>
                <p>I had to stop for the night</p>
                <p>There she stood in the doorway</p>
                <p>I heard the mission bell</p>
                <p>And I was thinking to myself,</p>
                <p>"This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"</p>
                <p>Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way</p>
                <p>There were voices down the corridor,</p>
                <p>I thought I heard them say...</p>
                <br>

                <p class="italic">Welcome to the Hotel California</p>
                <p class="italic">Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)</p>
                <p class="italic">Such a lovely face</p>
                <p class="italic">Plenty of room at the Hotel California</p>
                <p class="italic">Any time of year (Any time of year)</p>
                <p class="italic">You can find it here</p>
            
            
            <br>
            <p>Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends</p>
            <p>She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends</p>
            <p>How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat</p>
            <p>Some dance to remember, some dance to forget</p>
            <br>
            <p>So I called up the Captain,</p>
            <p>"Please bring me my wine"</p>
            <p>He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"</p>
            <p>And still those voices are calling from far away,</p>
            <p>Wake you up in the middle of the night</p>
            <p>Just to hear them say...</p>

                <p class="italic">Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)</p>
                <p class="italic">Such a lovely face</p>
                <p class="italic">They livin' it up at the Hotel California</p>
                <p class="italic">What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise)</p>
                <p class="italic">Bring your alibis</p>
                <br>
                <p>Mirrors on the ceiling,</p>
                <p>The pink champagne on ice</p>
                <p>And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"</p>
                <p>And in the master's chambers,</p>
                <p>They gathered for the feast</p>
                <p>They stab it with their steely knives,</p>
                <p>But they just can't kill the beast</p>
                <br>
                <p>Last thing I remember, I was</p>
                <p>Running for the door</p>
                <p>I had to find the passage back</p>
                <p>To the place I was before</p>
                <p>"Relax," said the night man,</p>
                <p>"We are programmed to receive.</p>
                <p>You can check-out anytime you like,</p>
                <p>But you can never leave!"</p>
