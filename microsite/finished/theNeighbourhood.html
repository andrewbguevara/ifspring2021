                Jeremy Freedman, one of the band’s two guitarrists and a background vocalist, started playing music after seeing his cousin’s first guitar, which was a Christmas gift. Influenced by heavy metal, he soon began looking for an electric guitar, and his first was a Gibson SG. As of 2015, Jeremy and the band have enjoyed a hit album, I Love You, and two songs on the charts, including the Number One single, “Sweater Weather.”
