            <p><span class="textTitle">Wiped Out!</span> is the second studio album by American alternative band The Neighbourhood. It was released on October 30, 2015 by Columbia Records. In late 2020, the song “Daddy Issues” went viral on TikTok, along with “Sweater Weather,” a song off of the band’s debut album I Love You. The album received generally mixed reviews. Writing for Exclaim!, Ryan B. Patrick called the record a “see what sticks” effort; it’s slick and polished, but hits varying levels of satisfaction throughout.” Natasha West, from DIY, said that “Wiped Out! delivers a message of heartbreak, hope and heartfelt honesty” and “having successfully mixed pop, rock and hip-hop together, it seems like they have finally defined their sound as a band.” A review published by Mojo Magazine, stated, “The LA quintet still sound like 16-year-old boys... Musically, though, their slick soulful pop-R&B is far more refined.” For Matt Collar, from AllMusic, it “doesn’t hurt that cuts like “Cry Baby,” “Daddy Issues,” and “Greetings from Califournia” counteract the band’s somewhat downtempo vibe with catchy melodies and light, dance-oriented beats. As the black & white album cover illustration of a palm tree on a beach implies, this is surf music for street goths and beach bums with bad attitudes.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>Kenneth Partridge, from Billboard, wrote, “The subtler, less stylized Wiped Out! keeps the palm-trees-at-twilight feel, but the sound is more hazy R&B than rock.” David Turner, from Rolling Stone, thinks that “the warmth of “Sweater Weather” and the rest of the Neighbourhood’s debut album is gone on Wiped Out!, replaced by a ponderous kind of cool” Uncut’s published review was that the album is “a stylistic and conceptual vacuum.”</p>

                Jeremy Freedman, one of the band’s two guitarrists and a background vocalist, started playing music after seeing his cousin’s first guitar, which was a Christmas gift. Influenced by heavy metal, he soon began looking for an electric guitar, and his first was a Gibson SG. As of 2015, Jeremy and the band have enjoyed a hit album, I Love You, and two songs on the charts, including the Number One single, “Sweater Weather.”
