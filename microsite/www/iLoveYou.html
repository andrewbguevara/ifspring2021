            <p><span class="textTitle">I Love You</span> (stylized as I Love You.) is the Neighbourhood’s debut studio album, released worldwide on April 22, 2013. The tracks on this album express a series of angst-ridden themes based on both the vibe and lyrical content of the songs. Former drummer Bryan Sammis explained to Coup De Main magazine: “I think that at least in terms of the musical aspect of it, all of us try and get our own emotions out through our instruments, which is not always the easiest thing to do. I think for Jesse Rutherford lyrically, what I really like about him and about us as a band is that a lot of his lyrics aren’t necessarily pre-ordained, because he’s not trying to force it. A lot of his lyrics are off the top of his head when he first hears the song, because that makes it more natural, it’s legitimately what he is thinking about and how he is feeling when he hears that song.”</p>

                Jeremy Freedman, one of the band’s two guitarrists and a background vocalist, started playing music after seeing his cousin’s first guitar, which was a Christmas gift. Influenced by heavy metal, he soon began looking for an electric guitar, and his first was a Gibson SG. As of 2015, Jeremy and the band have enjoyed a hit album, I Love You, and two songs on the charts, including the Number One single, “Sweater Weather.”
